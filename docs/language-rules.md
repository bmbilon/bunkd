# Bunkd Language Rules

## Core Principle

**We measure evidence, not truth. We report findings, not judgments.**

## Never Say

❌ **"False"** - We cannot determine absolute truth
❌ **"Misleading"** - Implies intent we cannot verify
❌ **"Scam"** - Legal liability + intent assumption
❌ **"Lie"** / **"Lying"** - Requires proof of intent
❌ **"Fake"** - Too absolute
❌ **"Deceptive"** - Intent-based
❌ **"Fraudulent"** - Legal term requiring proof

## Always Say

✅ **"Not supported by available evidence"**
✅ **"Not found in public sources"**
✅ **"Unverified"** / **"Verification status: unverified"**
✅ **"No evidence found"** (as of [date])
✅ **"Claim lacks supporting documentation"**
✅ **"Cannot be confirmed from public sources"**

## Time Bounds (Critical)

Always include temporal context:

✅ "As of January 2026, no supporting evidence was found"
✅ "Based on sources accessed on [date]"
✅ "Current as of analysis date: [date]"

Never:
❌ Timeless claims like "this is false" (evidence may emerge)
❌ Absolute statements without date bounds

## Describe, Don't Judge

### Bad Examples
- "This product makes ridiculous claims"
- "Obviously a scam"
- "They're lying about the specs"

### Good Examples
- "The product description includes claims that lack supporting evidence"
- "No public documentation found for stated specifications"
- "Claims differ from available third-party test results"

## Bias Indicators (What to Call Them)

✅ **"Promotional language"**
✅ **"Vague superlatives"**
✅ **"Unsubstantiated claims"**
✅ **"Marketing-style language"**
✅ **"Claims without supporting specifications"**

Not:
❌ "Lies"
❌ "BS" (except in "BS Meter" brand context)
❌ "Hype" (too informal)

## Intent (Never Infer It)

We measure what's said vs. what's documented. We don't:
- Attribute motives
- Speculate about why evidence is missing
- Suggest deliberate deception

### Bad
- "They're hiding the truth"
- "Trying to mislead consumers"
- "Deliberately vague to avoid scrutiny"

### Good
- "Specific supporting data not found"
- "Claims lack technical specifications"
- "No third-party verification available"

## Confidence Levels

Use probabilistic language:

✅ "High confidence" / "Low confidence"
✅ "Likely" / "Unlikely" (when appropriate)
✅ "Consistent with" / "Inconsistent with"

Avoid absolutes:
❌ "Definitely"
❌ "Certainly"
❌ "Proves"

## Verified vs. Verified

"Verified" means:
- Claim matches publicly available evidence
- Multiple independent sources confirm
- Technical specs align with manufacturer docs

"Unverified" means:
- No supporting evidence found
- Cannot confirm from public sources
- Claim lacks documentation

NOT:
- "Verified" ≠ "true in all contexts"
- "Unverified" ≠ "false"

## Scoring Language

When explaining Bunkd Scores:

✅ **"Claims have substantial supporting evidence"** (High Score)
✅ **"Claims lack supporting evidence"** (Low Score)
✅ **"Limited documentation available"**

Not:
❌ "This product is BS" (even for low scores)
❌ "Full of lies"
❌ "Trustworthy" / "Untrustworthy" (we don't measure trust)

## Examples in Practice

### Product Claim
"Revolutionary AI technology that's 1000x faster than competitors"

### Bad Analysis
"This is obviously fake. No product is 1000x faster. They're lying to trick people into buying."

### Good Analysis
"The claim of '1000x faster' lacks supporting benchmarks or technical specifications. No independent performance testing found as of January 2026. The term 'revolutionary' is a promotional superlative without defined criteria. Confidence in verification: Low."

## Edge Cases

### When Evidence Contradicts Claims
✅ "Claim differs from third-party test results"
✅ "Stated specification inconsistent with manufacturer documentation"

Not:
❌ "They lied about the specs"

### When No Evidence Exists
✅ "No supporting evidence found in public sources as of [date]"
✅ "Claim cannot be verified from available documentation"

Not:
❌ "Made up"
❌ "Fabricated"

### When Claims Are Vague
✅ "Claim lacks specific, measurable criteria"
✅ "Promotional language without technical specifications"

Not:
❌ "Intentionally vague to avoid accountability"

## Legal Safety

This language framework:
- Avoids defamation risk (no intent claims)
- Maintains scientific neutrality
- Allows for evidence to emerge later
- Focuses on what we can verify, not what we suspect

## Internal Shorthand vs. Public Language

Internally, we can say:
- "High BS score" (meaning well-supported)
- "Low BS score" (meaning poorly-supported)

Publicly, always expand:
- "High Bunkd Score indicates strong evidence support"
- "Low Bunkd Score indicates minimal evidence support"

## Consistency Check

Before publishing any analysis, ask:
1. Did I avoid attributing intent?
2. Did I include temporal bounds?
3. Did I describe findings neutrally?
4. Could this be misread as a judgment of truth?
5. Is this defensible if challenged?

If you answered "no" or "maybe" to any, revise.
