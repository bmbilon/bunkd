# Bunkd Objectivity Charter

## Core Mission

Bunkd exists to measure how well public claims are supported by publicly available evidence.

## Canonical Definition

**Bunkd Score (BS) is a numerical measure (0–10) of how well public claims are supported by publicly available evidence.**

This definition appears in:
- Internal documentation
- System prompts
- The mobile app's "About / Methodology" view
- All public-facing materials

## Terminology Standards

### Primary Branding
- **BS Meter**: The measurement system (displayed prominently)
- **Bunkd Score**: The numerical output (secondary label)

### Never Say
- "Bullshit" or any variations
- "Objectivity Score" (deprecated)
- Ambiguous terms that could imply product quality judgments

### Score Tiers (Neutral Language Only)
- **Very High Bunkd Score** (9-10): Claims have comprehensive supporting evidence
- **High Bunkd Score** (7-8): Claims have substantial supporting evidence
- **Moderate Bunkd Score** (5-6): Claims have some supporting evidence
- **Low Bunkd Score** (3-4): Claims have minimal supporting evidence
- **Very Low Bunkd Score** (0-2): Claims have almost no supporting evidence

## Core Principles

### 1. Evidence-Based Analysis
We measure evidence availability, not product quality. A low Bunkd Score doesn't mean a product is bad—it means the claims lack evidence support.

### 2. Public Sources Only
Analysis relies exclusively on publicly accessible information. No insider knowledge, no proprietary testing, no assumptions.

### 3. Claim-Specific Evaluation
Each claim is evaluated individually:
- Is it specific or vague?
- Can it be verified?
- What sources support or contradict it?
- How strong is the confidence level?

### 4. Transparent Methodology
Users should understand:
- What we measure (evidence support)
- What we don't measure (product quality, value, subjective preferences)
- How scores are calculated
- What sources were consulted

### 5. No False Balance
Not all claims are equal. Measurable specifications ("6.1-inch display") receive different treatment than vague superlatives ("revolutionary design").

## What BS Meter Measures

✅ **We measure:**
- Specificity vs. vagueness in claims
- Availability of technical specifications
- Presence of citations and sources
- Use of promotional vs. descriptive language
- Comparative context and benchmarks

❌ **We do NOT measure:**
- Product quality or performance
- Value for money
- Subjective preferences (design, aesthetics)
- Brand reputation
- Customer satisfaction

## Scoring Philosophy

### Higher Scores = Better Evidence
- 9-10: Comprehensive evidence support
- 7-8: Substantial evidence support
- 5-6: Some evidence support
- 3-4: Minimal evidence support
- 0-2: Almost no evidence support

**Higher is better.** This is not inverted. A "Very High Bunkd Score" means strong evidence support.

## Bias Detection

We identify promotional language patterns:
- Vague superlatives without specifics
- Unverifiable claims
- Missing comparative context
- Absence of technical specifications
- Marketing-style language

These patterns indicate claims that cannot be easily verified against public evidence.

## Source Requirements

Valid sources must be:
- Publicly accessible
- Relevant to the specific claim
- Recent (when applicable)
- Authoritative or verifiable

We cite all sources used in analysis.

## Limitations

We acknowledge:
- Analysis is based on available public information only
- Some valid claims may lack public evidence
- Marketing context matters (regulated industries have stricter requirements)
- Human language is inherently ambiguous
- AI analysis has known limitations and biases

## Ethical Commitments

1. **Transparency**: Show our work, cite our sources
2. **Consistency**: Apply the same standards to all products
3. **Humility**: Acknowledge what we don't know
4. **Evolution**: Update our methodology as we learn
5. **User Agency**: Users make their own decisions with our analysis as one input

## Version History

- **v1.0** (January 2026): Initial Objectivity Charter with canonical BS Meter definition

---

*The BS Meter displays a Bunkd Score between 0 and 10. Higher values indicate stronger levels of supporting evidence for the evaluated claims.*
